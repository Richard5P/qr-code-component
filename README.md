# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is my solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

Apologies for the brevity - this is my first submission and I'm anxious for some feedback.  I'll add some more meaningful README info with
my next submission.

This comes close to but does not exactly match the example layouts. Even if it did, I'm sure there improvments that could be made.
Any and all advice, suggestions and/or corrections are welcome.
